## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the plausibility of a surf and icecream shop to be open all year. Considering the temperatures across the year would determine if it would make sense to keep the shop open during the colder months.

## Results:
-The average temperature difference is only 4 degrees (75 in June, 71 in December)

-The lowest recorded temperature in December was 56 degrees

-In about 50% of the days in December, the temperature was above 71 degrees 

## Summary:
Considering the relatively low difference in temperature averages between June and December, it is very plausible that the shop can be run all year. Although the data shows fairly low temperatures on certain days in December, there are still enough days where the weather is nice to make it a profitable decision. It would, however, be a good idea to analyze and compare the temperature data for the month of January as that is historically the coldest month for the region.
